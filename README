# Matrix Library: s21_matrix

This project implements a matrix manipulation library in C, following mathematical rules and precise error handling. It supports fundamental matrix operations and is designed for educational purposes within the School 21 program.

## Description

- **Matrix Creation and Deletion**: Dynamic allocation and safe removal of matrices.
- **Comparison**: Accurate comparison of matrices with floating-point tolerance.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication by number or matrix.
- **Advanced Operations**: Transposition, determinant calculation, algebraic complements, and inverse matrix.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C (C11)
- **Standard**: POSIX.1-2017
- **Style**: Google C++ Style Guide
- **Build**: Makefile to compile and test the matrix library
- **Testing**: Unit tests written using `Check` library
- **Coverage**: Unit tests must cover at least 80% of each function

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source files for matrix implementation
- `tests/`: Unit tests for all functions
- `Makefile`: Build and test automation

## Requirements

- `gcc` or any C11-compatible compiler
- `make`
- `check` (unit testing framework)
- `lcov` (for code coverage analysis)
